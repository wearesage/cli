Looking for some education
Made my way into the night
All that bullshit conversation
Baby, can't you read the signs?
I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right
But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
Had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
Looking for some affirmation
Made my way into the sun
My friends got their ladies
And they're all having babies
I just wanna have some fun
I won't bore you with the details, baby
I don't even wanna waste your time
Let's just say that maybe
You could help me ease my mind
I ain't Mr. Right
But if you're looking for fast love
If that's love in your eyes
It's more than enough
I've had some bad love
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh, ooh
Baby, baby
Ooh...
In the absence of security
I made my way into the night
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me
And I see nothing in his eyes
I miss my baby
Oh I, I miss my baby
I miss my baby
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss my baby
Ooh I...
I miss my baby
