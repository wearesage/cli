I grew a nipper in the wild wild west
And for a while I was at my best
So much so that I got hitched in a big white dress
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed
And so I got soaked in the wild wild west
I was galivanting in the silhouettes
That's when I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow catching in the wilderness
Don't waste your time when I've got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
Don't waste your time when I've got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya
From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego
Now I'm cutting shines in the wild wild west
I had to bed my man down to save my self
That's when I, I got churched in the wild west
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress
From LA to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I break my heart wherever I go
