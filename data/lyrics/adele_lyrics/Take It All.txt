Didn't I give it all,
Tried my best,
Gave you everything I had,
Everything and no less?
Didn't I do it right?
Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to—well—having me around.
Still how can you walk away from all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here.
But go on and take it (take it),
Take it all with you.
Don't look back (don't look back) at this crumbling fool.
Just take it all with my love,
Take it all with my love.
Maybe I should leave to help you see
Nothing is better than this
And this is everything we need.
So is it over?
Is this really it?
You've given up so easily.
I thought you loved me more than this.
But go on, go on and take it (take it)
Take it all with you.
Don't look back (don't look back) at this crumbling fool.
Just take it all with my love,
Take it all with my love.
I will change if I must.
Slow it down and bring it home.
I will adjust.
Oh, if only, if only you knew,
Everything I do is for you.
But go on, go on and take it (take it)
Take it all with you.
Don't look back (don't look back) at this crumbling fool.
Just take it (take it),
Take it all with you.
Don't look back (don't look back) at this crumbling fool.
Just take it all with my love,
Take it all with my love
Take it all with my love.
