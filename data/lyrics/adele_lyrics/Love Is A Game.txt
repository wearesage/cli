All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely you know, that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see, ee-ee, ee-ee
That love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
How unbelievable (Unbelievable)
Of me to fall, for the lies that I tell? (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell? (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (It's inevitable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?
When love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
No amount of love, can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Love (Ooh-ooh) is a game (Ooh-ooh) for fools to play (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain (Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah, ah)
I can love, I can love again
I love me now, like I love him
I'm a fool for that
You know I, you know I'm gonna do it
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I'd do it all again like I did it
