You've got your eye on me after all these years
You think that I can't see you from over here
I may be out of your view but I can hear you
I may be out of the room but I can see you
I know you still want me, you always will
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels
To never be free completely
Sometimes you just feel so empty

Like lately when I have been missing you
And I would still do anything for you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

I was far too reckless, I know that now
Trying to make you jealous made me feel proud
But now I'm in too deep to climb out
But know that I live with my doubt

Like lately when I have been missing you
And I want to do everything with you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

Since we were together everybody's changed
Our reflections in the mirror no longer look the same
And we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make
But I will always miss you at the end of each day

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

But we can't be together
No, we won't be together
