Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la la la la
Sha la la la la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(Sha la la la la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

How many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
(Sha la la la la)

You should hear what they say about you
(Cheat, cheat)
(Sha la la la la)
They say you never, never, never ever been true
(Cheat, cheat)
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do when it's true

Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la)
Yeah, oh

How many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do
Can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
Baby it's you
(Sha la la la la la)
Baby it's you
