You say I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving I think way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer, my dear."
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'd never match at all, but we do
But we do, but we do, but we do
I thought I knew myself, somehow you know me more
I've never known this, never before
You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you
You're so provocative, I'm so conservative
And you're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining
You'd think we wouldn't, we do, but we do, but we do, but we do
Favouritism ain't my thing but in this situation I'd be glad...
Favouritism ain't my thing but in this situation I'd be glad to make an exception
You say I'm stubborn and I never give in
I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish, I agree with you on that
I think you're giving, I think way too much in fact
I say we've only known each other one year
You say, "Pff, I've known you longer, my dear."
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other, think we'd never match at all, but we do
