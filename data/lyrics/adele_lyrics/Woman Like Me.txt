You're driving me away
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you
But not in this way
I don't think you quite understand
Who you have on your hands
How can you not see
Just how good for you I am?
I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in
'Cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow
We ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere
Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me
All you do is complain
About decisions you make
How can I help lift you
If you refuse to activate
The life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place
But you will never give it up
It's where they make you feel powerful
That's why you think I make you feel small
But that's your projection
It's not my rejection
I put my heart on the line
For the very first time
Because you asked me to
And now you've gone and changed your mind
But loving you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get
The love I have for you
'Cause you don't care
Uh hmm
Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key...
