Pave me a path to follow
And I'll tread any dangerous road
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home

Throw me to the water (Water, water)
I don't care how deep or shallow (Water)
Because my heart can pound like thunder (Water)
And your love, and your love can set me free

I have promised I will love you till the end of time
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme
All I want is for you to be mine

So can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?

You tease me with your control
Because I long to live under your spell
And without your love I'm hollow
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own

I have promised I will love you till the end of time (End of time)
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine (The divine)
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme (Mm, mm-mm)
All I want is for you to be mine

So can I get it right now? Mm
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
Can I get it?

When will you run with me
Like I know you want to?
(Like you want to, like you want)
You're the one for me
And I'm counting on you
To put the pieces of me back together

So can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Can I get it right now?
Let me, let me just come and get it
