Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace
Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I walk in a room
I'm invisible, I feel like a ghost (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
All my friends keep on telling me that this feeling won't last (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I have nothing to feel no more
I can't even cry (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace
Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I wake up
I'm afraid at the idea of facing the day
I would rather stay home on my own, drink it all away
Please stop calling me, it's exhausting
There's really nothing left to say
I created this storm
It's only fair I have to sit in its rain

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace
Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

All love is devout
No feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now
Before it's too late
In the end it's just you
Stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it

Cry your heart out (Cry, yeah)
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace
