'Cause I'm all that you want, boy
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby (Woo)
Looks like you been starvin'
You got those hungry eyes (Woo)
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right (Woo)
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in (Woo)
You want what I'm cookin', boy
Let me take you (Woo)
Under candlelight
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay (Woo)
If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (All that you want)
All that you can have, boy (Ayy)

Bon a—, bon appétit, baby (Bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven (Fresh out the oven)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'

'Cause I'm all that you want, boy (Woo)
All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon a—, bon appétit, baby (Bon appétit)
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven (Woo)
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin' (Hey)

Sweet potato pie. Sweet
It'll change your mind. Change
Got you runnin' back for seconds. Runnin'
Every single night. Ayy (I'm the one they say can change your life (Takeoff))
(No waterfall, she drippin' wet just like my ice (Blast))
(Say she want a Migo night, I ask her, "What's the price?" (Hold on))
(If she do right, told her, "Get whatever you like") {Offset}
{I grab her legs and now divide, aight (Aight)}
{Make her do a donut when she ride, aight (Skrrt)}
{Lookin' at the eyes of a dime, make you blind (Dime)}
{In her spine and my diamonds change the climate (Shine} yeah
Sweet tooth, sweet, no tooth fairy, no
Whipped cream, whip, no dairy, whip
Got her hot light on, screamin', "I'm ready". Hot
But no horses, woo, no carriage, hey *go ahead*
