Is it the way I talk sweet, the way my skin is soft?
Or how I can be a bitch, and make you keep your fingers crossed?
Is it the way that I praise you, the way that I please you?

Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me
Is it the way I cut my hair and put no makeup on?
I feel most beautiful doing what the fuck I want

Could spend your whole life but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
She's always been a perfect mystery
Could spend your whole life but you couldn't
Describe what makes a woman
And that's what makes a woman to me (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) That's what makes a woman to me
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Oh, yeah, yeah-yeah
(Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah) Is it the way we keep the whole world turning?
In a pair of heels, yeah, that's what makes a woman (There it is, Katheryn)
