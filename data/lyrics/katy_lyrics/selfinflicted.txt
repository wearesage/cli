Remember when I dove into the crowd
And I got a bloody knee?
Under my skin
A mark from wiping out
It brings back the memories
Every bone's been broken
But my heart is still wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to
With each scar, there's
A map that tells a story
What a souvenir of
Young love's like
Jumping out an airplane
Riding a tidal wave of
An ocean of emotion
(Of emotion)
My heart rips me wide open
I can't stop, don't care if I lose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
I'm going down in flames for you
Oh, you are the weapon I choose
These wounds are self-inflicted
One more thing I'm addicted to, oh
No, I can't stop
Oh, I can't stop, no, I can't stop
And I'm going out in flames
Oh, I'm going down in flames
I, I, I, I
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
Baby, you are the weapon I choose
(I, I, I, I)
