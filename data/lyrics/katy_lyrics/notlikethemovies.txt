He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know
I didn't feel the fairytale feeling
No
Am I a stupid girl for even dreaming
That I could?
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one
I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning
Snow White said when I was young
"One day my prince will come."
So I'll wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes
If stars don't align
If it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign
Wait for it
One hundred percent
Worth every penny spent
He'll be the one
That finishes your sentences
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one
I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning
'Cause I know you're out there
And you're—you're looking for me, oh
It's a crazy idea
That you were made perfectly for me
You'll see
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic
With the perfect ending
It's not like the movies
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one
You'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning
