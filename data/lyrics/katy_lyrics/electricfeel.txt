All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She's got the current in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Sun in the Amazon
With the voltage running through his skin
Standing there with nothing on
She's gonna teach me how to swim
Oh, oh, oh
Said, "Ooh-ooh, girl"
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
Said, "Ooh-ooh, girl"
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
And turn me on with your electric feel, oh
All along the Eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity
'Cause you can feel it in your mind
Oh, you can do it all the time
Plug it in and change the world
'Cause, you are my electric girl
I've said, "Ooh-ooh, girl"
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel
Said, "Ooh-ooh, girl"
Shocked me like an electric eel
Baby girl
And turn me on with your electric feel, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
Hey, hey
Mm, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now
Elec-electric feel now
Do what you feel now
Electric feel now
