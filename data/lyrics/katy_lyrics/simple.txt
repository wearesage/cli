You're such a poet
I wish I could be Wesley Willis
My words would flow like honey, sweet and laid on thick
You're so edgy
You don't even need a rhyming dictionary
I wipe my hands on your jeans, 'cause they are more distressed
So they say you got O.C.D.
And they claim you can barely read
But you say, "Don't bother me with all of your reality."
But it could be so simple (You're overthinking)
Life should be that simple (Who would have thought it?)
I wish it were just so simple (You're overthinking)
But the point's been missed
You've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh, mm-mm-mm)
So what, you're a genius?
But you've got a lot to learn
Like the time you lost your apartment
'Cause you bought too much Vuitton
You park (Park) in a loading zone
You sleep (Sleep) with the lights all on
You cross your i's and dot your t's
All it goes to show
That it could be so simple (You're overthinking)
Life should be that simple (Who would have thought it?)
I wish it were just that simple (You're overthinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems?
I'm not saying that it's a piece of cake
Just take a moment to evaluate
The possibilities
The situations
The opportunities
That are waiting
Oh, the possibilities
Oh, I
It could, it could be that simple (You're overthinking)
Life should be that simple (Who would have thought it?)
I wish it were just so simple (You're overthinking)
The point's been missed
We've made a mess
Who would have guessed
That it's as simple as it seems?
We could talk all day
About your eccentricities
What I mean to say
Oh-oh, is that I need you listen, please
And focus on, on life's simplicities
So don't be afraid to strip it away
'Cause at the end of the day
It's still as simple as it seems
It is all so simple
Just deal with it
