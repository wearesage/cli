I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
I got a vision
Keepin' me up at night (Up at night)
My intuition's
Tellin' me things ain't right (Things ain't right)
Can't look in the mirror
What is it you're tryna hide?
Can't give me your password
To your phone, not start a fight
You're treatin' me different
Tell me what's goin' through your mind
You're actin' so distant
Who do you see when you close your eyes?
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
Show me the fire
Show me the flames
Don't try to hide it
Spare me the pain
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
My father told me
The truth will set you free (Set you free)
I read your history
Now it makes sense to me (Sense to me)
I look in the mirror
See someone who's calm and strong
I've never been clearer
I'm at peace with movin' on
I'm seein' it different
Now that I'm outside of the storm
I'm feelin' the distance
It's always dark before the dawn
I wanna know the truth
Even it if hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
I wanna know the truth
Even it if hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
Show me the fire
Show me the flames
Don't try to hide it
Spare me the pain (Spare me the pain)
I wanna know the truth
Even if it hurt, hurts me (Hurts me, hurts me)
The person you're trying to reach is not available
Hey babe, where are you?
I can't get a hold of you
We really should talk, where are you?
