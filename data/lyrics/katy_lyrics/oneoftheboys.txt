I saw a spider
I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dawg dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way
The way
You look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
You high fives
Your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters
So I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys
So over the summer
Something changed
I started reading "Seventeen" and
Shaving my legs and
And I studied "Lolita" religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you
Staring at me
'Cause I know what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
It's okay
Maybe one day
But not until you gimme my
Diamond ring
'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your
Homecoming queen
Pin up poster dream
Not one the boys
I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day you're
Gonna wanna make out
Make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be (don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (don't wanna be)
'Cause I don't wanna be
One of the boys
One of your guys
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be
One of the girls
Pretty in pearls
Not one of the boys
