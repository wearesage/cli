Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
I felt it, the wire touched my neck and
Then someone pulled it tighter, I never saw it coming
I started to black out and then someone said good mornin'
I took it as a warning, I should've seen it coming
So now I'll take a chance on this thing we may have started
Intentional or not I don't think we saw it coming
It's all addin' up to something
That as for some involvement, that as for a commitment
I think I see it comin' if we stepped out on that limb
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause you're the best I've got
So take a long shot
I realize that there is all this doubting
Things we're both scared about that
We'll never see 'em coming, throw caution to the wind and
We'll see which way it's blowing into this fully knowing
We'll never see it coming 'til it's much too close to stop
My heartbeat beats me senselessly
Why's everything gotta be so intense with me?
I'm tryna handle all this unpredictability
In all probability
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause I'm the best you've got
So take a long shot
Oh, I waited for fact to come of fiction
And you fit my description
I never saw you coming, but we'll make it even though
It's a long shot, but I say why not
If I say forget it, I know that I'll regret it
It's a long shot just to beat the odds
The chance is we won't make it
But I know if I don't take it, there's no chance
'Cause I'm the best I got
So take a long shot
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw me coming
You didn't expect this
Oh, you never saw this coming
I take the long shot
I take the long shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
'Cause you're the best I've got
Oh, I'm taking this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance on you, baby
I'm taking this chance
