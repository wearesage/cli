Got a call from my friend
She saw my picture again
In a magazine
We laughed out loud
'Cause she said, "Remember when this was all a silly dream?"
Now I wake up every day
In a different city
A smile on my face
Somebody pinch me
She said, "All the world's a stage,"
But, girl, you know
Those cameras and lights
Won't ever change me
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends

'Cause when it all fades away
My home will still be the same
Ooh
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I come off tour
I slip back into my jeans
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
I don't need champagne
When I'm back home with my friends
We drink our beer on the porch
'Cause I'm still the girl next door
No fancy things when I...
