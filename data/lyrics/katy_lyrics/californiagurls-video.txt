[Snoop Dogg:]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Katy:]
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (at us)
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
We'll melt your popsicle
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent
Now put your hands up
Sex on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast)
Now put your hands up

[Snoop Dogg:]
Toned, tan, fit and ready
Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy
Wild Wild West Coast
These are the girls I love the most
I mean the ones I mean like she's the one
Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep
And live on the beach
I'm okay
I won't play
I love the bait
Just like I love LA
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys
Bangin' out
All that ass hangin' out
Bikinis, zucchinis
Martinis, no weenies
Just the King and the Queeny
Katy, my lady (yeah)
Lookie here, baby (uh huh)
I'm all up on ya
'Cause you're representin' California (oh yeah)

[Katy:]
California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot
We'll melt your popsicle
California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West Coast represent (West Coast, West Coast)
Now put your hands up

[Snoop Dogg:]
(California, California girls)
California girls, man
(California, California girls)
I really wish you all could be California girls
