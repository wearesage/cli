I woke up, got another day
I woke up, let's celebrate
Throw your hands up in the sky
If you're happy you're alive
I woke up, got another day
The sun is shining, let's get a matcha latte
I keep on smiling, oh yeah, I'm cheesing
I feel like skipping, come on and join the party
Today I'm winning, it's happy season (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
When I'm feeling blue, yeah, I know what to do (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
I just open my eyes and sing every time
I woke up, got another day
I woke up, let's celebrate
Throw your hands up in the sky
If you're happy you're alive
I woke up, got another day
So what? It's raining, I'm jumping in the puddles
I ain't complainin', I'm celebratin'
I feel amazing, nothing can burst my bubble
Let's pound it on the knuckles, oh yeah (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
When I'm feeling blue, yeah, I know what to do (Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
I just open my eyes and sing every time
I woke up, got another day
I woke up, let's celebrate
Throw your hands up in the sky
If you're happy you're alive
I woke up, got another day
I woke up, got another day (I woke up; got another day)
I woke up, let's celebrate (I woke up; let's celebrate)
Throw your hands up in the sky
If you're happy you're alive
I woke up, got another day (I woke up; got another day)
I woke up, got another day
I woke up, let's celebrate
I woke up, got another day
I woke up, let's celebrate
