Isn't it strange, that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird, that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather, okay
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers, yeah
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny 'cause now
There's nothing left but small talk?
Isn't it wild, that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward, I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while
Before we can just be friends
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers (Small talk)
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny 'cause now
There's nothing left but small talk?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
And I just can't believe we went from strangers to lovers to strangers
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny 'cause now
There's nothing left but small talk?
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Blah blah blah blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
