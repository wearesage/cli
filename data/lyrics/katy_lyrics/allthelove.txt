Only love, only love
Only love, only love
I had accepted
Love wasn't for me
I'd never go deep
Oh no
I'd given up watching sunsets
I disconnected
I didn't believe
No, I couldn't see
Oh no
I would just live with the regrets
I had nothing left
But you came along and
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
I was frozen
I was hopeless
Now there's poetry in every moment
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
Back to me, back to me
Back, back to me, back to me (Came back to me)
Back, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me (Came back to me)
Feels like I'm floating
The colors so bright
When I look in your eyes
Oh yeah
I needed you to set me free
Now everything's golden
Since you arrived
I'm higher than high
Oh yeah
Still can't believe that you found me
I can finally breathe
Yeah, you gave me life and
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
I was frozen (Frozen)
I was hopeless (Hopeless)
Now there's poetry in every moment
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
Back to me, back to me
Back, back to me, back to me (Came back to me)
Back, back to me, back to me
Back to me, back to me (Came back to me)
All the love that I ever lost came back to me
