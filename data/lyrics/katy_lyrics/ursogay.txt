You bitch and moan about LA
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock, it's almost an art

No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like

No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like boys
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No, you don't even like
No, you don't even like
