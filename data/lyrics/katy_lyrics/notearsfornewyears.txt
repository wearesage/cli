I promise you no more tears for New Year's
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
Soon as it hits twelve o'clock
That's when all the crying stops
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
It's almost midnight in Malibu
Tonight I'm kissin' strangers
This black mascara is waterproof
'Cause I'm on my worst behavior
Yeah, I could swear off the wine (Oh, no, no)
Yeah, I could go on a diet (Oh, no, no)
First thing on my list I'm gonna do
Is quitting you, heartbreaker
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
Soon as it hits twelve o'clock
That's when all the crying stops
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
Three hundred sixty-four days ago
I showed you Santa Barbara
Got drunk at Joe's, crashed our bicycles
You even met my mama
She saw that look in your eyes (Oh, no, no)
She knew something wasn't right (Oh, no, no)
I can't believe I was such a fool
For thinking I could change ya (I could change ya)
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
Soon as it hits twelve o'clock
That's when all the crying stops
I promise you no more tears for New Year's
