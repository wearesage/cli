Lay me down at your altar, baby
I'm a slave to this love
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tongues
I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower, a desert rose
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float
Flying high as a kite on your love
Lost in sweet ecstasy
Found a nirvana finally
Magical one, a mystery
All of your charms have worked on me
I will surrender myself
Holy hell and heaven high
You have opened up my eyes
And I am finally healed
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float (You make me float, you make me float)
This is spiritual, under your spell
So phenomenal, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, all aglow
Like a feather, you make me float (Oh, you make me float, oh, you make me float)
