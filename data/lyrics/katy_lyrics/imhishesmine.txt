(feat. Doechii)
Do-Do-Do-Do-Do, Doechii and Katy up in the spot
Doechii and Katy
I'm his queen, I'm his freak
I'm every woman he wants and needs
I'm his dream, I'm his drug
I'm every woman he wants, so what?
I'm his boss, I'm that bitch
I'm every woman he knows exists
I'm his main, I'm his side
I'm every woman that's in his mind
La-da-dee, la-da-da
La-da-dee, la-da-da
I'm his, he's mine
La-da-dee, la-da-da
La-da-dee, la-da-da
I'm his, he's mine
I can see you flirtin'
Why you overworkin'?
On him like a suntan
Go and get your own man
Thinkin' that we're over (Over)
We only gettin' closer (Closer)
You're creepin' in his DMs
I'm sleepin' in his sweatpants
We good, we fine
Don't even try (Don't you try)
Don't waste your time
I'm what he likes (What he likes)
I'm his queen, I'm his freak
I'm every woman he wants and needs
I'm his dream, I'm his drug
I'm every woman he wants, so what?
I'm his boss, I'm that bitch
I'm every woman he knows exists (Yeah)
I'm his main, I'm his side
I'm every woman that's in his mind
La-da-dee, la-da-da
La-da-dee, la-da-da
I'm his, he's mine
La-da-dee, la-da-da
La-da-dee, la-da-da
I'm his, he's mine (Doechii)
What you tryna do? Baby, lock in
We could get it in, you could bring a friend
Hoes so pressed when I step in the spot
I'm so possessive and nonchalant
Upper echelon, pullin' up in the shade
If you try to vibe with him, might catch a fade
I be so aggressive and narcissistic
You know I'ma slide on a ho about a big D
Baby, we good
We good, we fine
Don't even try (Don't try)
Don't you try (Don't try it)
Don't waste your time
I'm what he likes (What he likes)
What he likes (What he likes)
I'm his queen, I'm his freak
I'm every woman he wants and needs
I'm his dream, I'm his drug
I'm every woman he wants, so what?
I'm his boss, I'm that bitch
I'm every woman he knows exists (Yeah)
I'm his main, I'm his side
I'm every woman that's in his mind
La-da-dee, la-da-da
La-da-dee, la-da-da
I'm his, he's mine
La-da-dee, la-da-da
La-da-dee, la-da-da
I'm his, he's mine
