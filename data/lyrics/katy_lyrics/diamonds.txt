I've got people to see
Places to go
Deadlines to meet
A reputation to up hold
It's like a ton of bricks
Breaking on my back
It's like
The force of gravity
In full effect
I got money to burn
And I'm on the sake
They bet their bomb on me
'Cause I'm their ace of spades
I feel the walls
Getting closer
I'm like a bomb
With all red wires
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means I'm gonna be
A diamond
It won't ever bend
A diamond
'Cause they're ladies'
Best friends
a diamond
But there
There has to be more
Than what these pirates
Are gambling for
If not for the push
I'd probably be a pebble
If not for the pressure
I'd be forgotten forever
Just another stone
Skipped upon the water
Drowning fast before
The other failures
I don't wanna be
A distant memory
On your wall
Just another CD
That you burned
And never bought
Am I not worth it to you?
After all that drama
That we've been though?
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe it means I'm gonna be
All this pressure
All this pressure
Maybe this means I'm gonna be
I'm a diamond in the sky
With you standing by
Now catch me if I fall
Into the arms of a coma
All this pressure
I've got pressure
I'm gonna be a diamond baby
I've gotta be a diamond
Your gonna see
I'm gonna be a diamond
