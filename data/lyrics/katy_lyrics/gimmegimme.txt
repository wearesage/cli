(feat. 21 Savage)
Big dog savage, I'm the man of your dreams (21)
I heard you gotta jump just to put on your jeans
I'm like Amazon 'cause I got what you need (21)
She gave me her heart, so I gave her my keys (21)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time
Kitty, kitty wanna come party tonight
Trippy, trippy daddy, take me on a ride
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Tell me, baby, 'cause I'm listening
Stimulate me with your fantasies
Say the right thing, maybe you can be
Crawlin' on me like a centipede
Freaks only come out at night
Tryna flex in the texts, they all bark with no bite (With no bite)
Please, gotta know what I like
Turn me on all night long, and you know that I might (That I might)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time
Kitty, kitty wanna come party tonight
Trippy, trippy daddy, take me on a ride
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Whoa
Blow my mind
Blow her mind, get on my knees, she fine (21, fine)
Quarters, I don't do dimes (No dimes)
Stones on her neck, they shine (Bling)
He say he the one, he lyin' (21)
You want me to chase, be mine (Yeah)
I ran out of breath, I'm tryin' (On God)
You don't see what I see, you blind (21)
Five stars whenever we eat (Yeah)
All I know is this feelin' is deep (Deep)
If you gimme your heart, it's for keeps (21)
When you with me, I know you at peace (21)
Take my card and go shoppin' for weeks (On God)
No limit, you shoppin' for free (On God)
I'm in Paris, I'm shoppin' for we (21)
Girl, stop all that playin' with me (21, 21)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
