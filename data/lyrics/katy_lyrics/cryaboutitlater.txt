I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new
I know tomorrow, I'll be love hungover
But I'm ready for a shameless summer
Champagne on ice only makes you stronger
Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it nonstop (Ah)
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up (Ah)
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new
I think I'm ready to be someone's new muse
I think I'm ready for a brand new tattoo (Give me it)
I'm gonna fake it 'til it makes me feel good
Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it nonstop (One more; ah, ooh)
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up (Ah, ooh)
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her, yeah
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' some
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun (Ooh, I'll cry about it later)
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new
Ooh
I know tomorrow, I'll be love hungover (Ooh)
And it's half past three (Past three)
And I got angel wings (Wings)
But a devil's grin
And only one can win
No, no, no, no
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun (Ooh, ooh)
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' some (Ooh, ooh)
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun (Ooh, I'll cry about it later)
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new
