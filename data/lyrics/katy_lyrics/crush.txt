Is it a crush?
Makin' me blush
Here I go again, I'm fallin' in love
Catchin' my breath
Whenever we touch
Here I go again, I'm fallin' in love
My heart goes
La, dada, dee
La, la, dee
La, dada, dee
My heart goes
La, dada, dee
La, da, dee
La, dada, dee
Feelin' all the butterflies
Livin' in a candy daydream
'Motions that I can't describe
Even all the birds are singing
Yeah I, I got those palpitations
Those boom, boom, booms
I'm on a new vibration
Yeah, I, I need some medication
Your ooh, ooh, ooh
I need an explanation
Is it a crush?
Makin' me blush
Here I go again, I'm fallin' in love
Catchin' my breath
Whenever we touch
Here I go again, I'm fallin' in love
My heart goes
La, dada, dee
La, da, dee
La, dada, dee
My heart goes
La, dada, dee
La, la, dee
La, dada, dee
My heart goes
I know that you feel the same
Giving me the right frequency
Every time you say my name (My name)
Baby, I don't need persuading
Yeah I, I got those palpitations
Those boom, boom, booms
I'm on a new vibration
Yeah, I, I need some medication
Your ooh, ooh, ooh
Come on, answer the question
Is it a crush?
Making me blush
Here I go again, I'm fallin' in love
Catchin' my breath
Whenever we touch
Here I go again, I'm fallin' in love
My heart goes
La, dada, dee
La, da, dee
La, dada, dee
My heart goes
La, dada, dee
La, la, dee
La, dada, dee
My heart goes
