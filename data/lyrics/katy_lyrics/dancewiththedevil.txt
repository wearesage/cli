I lost my tug of war today
Took my foot off of the brakes
(The definition of insanity is looping on repeat, and expecting things to change)
But what comes up must hit the ground
So I drink these anvils down
(She always comes to me highly disguised, an angel whispering, so many pretty shapes)
It's a dance with the devil
A stumbling tango
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance (Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance (Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance
Just want to connect
But you won't let me do it
So I get altered,
(Twisted and conflicted, so I casually can shoot the shit)
Wish less was going on
Wish I could just throw the ball
And ignore it all
(Constantly distracted by the noise of my ping-pong)
It's a dance with the devil
A mercurial wrestle
It's a dance with the devil
Trying to borrow from tomorrow
It's a dance (Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a dance (Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
It's a... (Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
But what, what is it worth
Waking up with a crown of clouds?
What is it worth
When my head spins out with doubt?
Wish I could measure
When the poison is pouring out
Oh...
It's a dance (Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you (It's a dance)
(Oh, no, oh, no, I don't need you)
Oh, no, oh, no (It's a...)
