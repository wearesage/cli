(feat. Skip Marley)
[Katy Perry:]
Chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Turn it up, keep it on repeat
This one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Rhythm
Turn it up turn it up, yeah
Alright, don't you get on now
Chained to the rythm (to the rythm)
Chained to the rythm (to the rythm)
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Are we crazy?
Living our life through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Turn it up
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, trouble
So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on
Turn it up
Dance, dance, dance
Turn it up
Keep it on repeat
Like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance
Turn it up
Keep it on repeat
Yeah, we think we're free
This one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Skip Marley:]
It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions (Woo!)

[Katy Perry & Skip Marley:]
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion (turn it up, turn it up yeah)
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie (like a wasted zombie)
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
Oh we're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

[Katy Perry:]
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes
It goes on, and on, and on
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
On, and on, and on, it goes
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
Turn it up, Turn it up up
