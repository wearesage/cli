I want kindness
Sometimes it can be a neighbor
It can be a stranger
Doesn't matter who you are
If we all give a little kindness
Something to remind us
Everybody has a heart
When life's a bummer
And suddenly the rug gets pulled from under
Feels like the cloud is gonna last forever
But then you show up with a loving gesture
And make it better
If you're going through something
Reach out, hug someone
Tell 'em you love 'em
Hey, hey, hey
If you're going through something
Reach out, call someone
Tell 'em you love 'em
Hey, hey, hey
Sometimes it can be a neighbor
It can be a stranger
Doesn't matter who you are
If we all give a little kindness
Something to remind us
Everybody has a heart
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh
Everybody has a heart
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh, oh
Everybody has a heart (Yeah)
Yeah, we're all so different
But I think we can all agree on one thing
Love is the answer to all of our questions
So when you hear this song, pass on the message
We're all connected
If you're going through something
Reach out, hug someone
Tell 'em you love 'em
Hey, hey, hey
If you're going through something
Reach out, call someone
Tell 'em you love 'em
Hey, hey, hey
Sometimes it can be a neighbor
It can be a stranger
Doesn't matter who you are
If we all give a little kindness
Something to remind us
Everybody has a heart
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh (Everybody)
Everybody has a heart
Everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, everyone, oh (Everybody)
Everybody has a heart (Yeah)
I love you
