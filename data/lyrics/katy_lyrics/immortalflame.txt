(from "Final Fantasy Brave Exvius" soundtrack)
Lightning strikes only once in your life
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
In the line of fire tonight
My heart beats like thunder under my skin
And my world speaks in wonder since you appeared
Now we are here
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame
Dreams hardly ever do come true
I guess I'm lucky 'cause I've found myself
Waking up right next to you
Oh, and with this raging heart of mine
I'll love you 'til the end of time
I thank the gods that our stars align
From the ocean floor to the distant sun
Forever more to kingdom come
Have no fear, I'll be burning here
And I could die (I could die)
In your arms tonight
But it would be a shame (A shame)
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame (Your immortal)
I'll be your (Your immortal)
Ooh, I'll be your (Your immortal)
Oh, I'll be your (Your immortal flame)
And I could die in your arms tonight
But it would be a shame
'Cause I want to live a thousand lives
And be your immortal flame
Love you again and again
An everlasting fantasy
I'll be your immortal
