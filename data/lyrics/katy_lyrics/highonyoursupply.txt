Your Instagram, embarrassing
Living a poser life
Got bigger lips and paid friendships
But losing the light in your eyes
Your only friend, your reflection
Arching your back for likes
I knew you when we'd laugh at them
Now you're the stereotype (Stereotype)
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen
You got a vibe so broken
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
You're cooler than these sycophants
Who wanna be part of the show
It's hard to hear, but oh so clear
You're not in on the joke
I'm only here because I care
I know it's a lonely road
I knew you when we had nothin'
And that's why I don't blow smoke (I won't blow smoke)
Oh babe, you got high on your supply
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen (You got a head so)
You got a vibe so broken (You got a vibe so)
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
High on your supply (Hi-high) (You're so high, you're so high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
Who will be around when you come down from off your cloud?
Tell me, who will be around when you come down from off your cloud?
Oh babe, you got high on your supply (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
You fell in, and now you're trippin'
Yeah, you got high on your supply
Bought the hype and now you're slippin'
You got a head so swollen (You got a head so)
You got a vibe so broken (You got a vibe so)
Why oh, why do you keep telling yourself all of them lies
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
High on your supply (Hi-high) (You're so high, you're so high)
High on your supply (Hi-high)
High on your supply
Tell yourself another lie
