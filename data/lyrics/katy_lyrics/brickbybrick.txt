The weight of my words
Are like feathers from a bird
My mouth, it moves, but you won't hear a thing
'Cause I've dug myself deep
I managed to fit both my hands and feet
All my little white lies
Smell like a big old bucket of bleach
In one ear and out your other
So lock and key
You won't open up for me
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
And it feels like you're in China
And I am in Peru
Whenever I am sleeping next to you, oh
We can hear the crickets singing
Oh, all throughout the night
Oh, boy, can't you just get used to something so right?
And sure, I confess
I'm a mess, I'm a mess of mistakes
But please count to ten before you go and throw it all away
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up
I'm not giving up on us
'Cause if you give up
Then what am I supposed to do?
All of our dreams never will come true without you
So brick by brick
I am breaking through these walls
Oh, between you and me
I'm not giving up, up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not giving, giving up
I'm not giving, giving up
Oh, baby
Don't give up on this love
