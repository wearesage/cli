(feat. JID)
Who's gonna save us
From losin' our minds?
Oh, you're so dangerous
Devil in disguise
Why you so, why you so
Why you so, why you so
Artificial?
You got me divin' deep in your system
I'm just a prisoner in your prison
You got me hooked on your algorithm
Are you real or artificial?
So what's the deal
Huh?
Tell me, are you fake or are you real
Huh?
How do I connect if I can't feel ya?
Sooner or later, I will reveal ya
Artificial
So what you thinkin'?
Do you put emotions over reason?
Are you gonna love me like a human?
Can you touch me in a simulation?
Who's gonna save us
From losin' our minds?
Oh, you're so dangerous
Devil in disguise
Baby, tell me, tell me
Does your heart beat, heart beat? (Oh)
Who's gonna save us
From losin' our minds?
Why you so, why you so
Why you so, why you so
Artificial?
Uh, look, am I trapped in a maze, are we lost in the Matrix?
Animalistic instincts, it's all nature
Behind enemy lines of animation, scribbled upon a page, we stuck in a simulation
Stuck in between a rock and a hard place, you know the sayin'
I'm dealin' with similar situations
I see the angles that everybody takin', angels, demons, a lotta demonstrations
Artificial-intelligent information
I been developin' truth, I took a bite into the bitterest forbidden fruit
It's not a vitamin, venom is unpredictable, too many vices
I hear the voices, sirens then silence
It's getting closer, I'm closin' my eyelids
But when it's over, my head to the sky
And I realize everybody wears a disguise
Who's gonna save us
From losin' our minds?
Oh, you're so dangerous
Devil in disguise
Baby, tell me, tell me (Tell me)
Does your heart beat, heart beat? (Oh)
Who's gonna save us
From losin' our minds?
Why you so, why you so
Why you so, why you so
Artificial?
