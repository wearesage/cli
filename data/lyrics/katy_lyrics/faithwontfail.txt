Yeah, yeah
You could throw me in the fire
And I won't be burned
For my faith is Your desire
And Your, Your love endures
You could throw me in the prison cell
Shackle me up against the rail
But time and time again
My faith won't fail
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He'll, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, time and time again
My faith won't fail
You could cast me in the lion's den
But they won't harm me
For Your grace surrounds me
And it sets me free
And I can walk upon the water
And I will not drown
For my eyes are set upon You
And no one can bring me down
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He'll will pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail
For His angels surround me
And You've poured out this blood covering, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I will walk and not fail, oh
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Time and time again
My faith won't fail
For He'll prevail
In the midst of all my trials and tribulations
He'll prevail
In the midst of all my sin and temptations
He'll prevail
When I fall and He will, He'll pick me up
For time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, for time and time again
My faith won't fail
Oh, for time and time again
My faith won't fail
