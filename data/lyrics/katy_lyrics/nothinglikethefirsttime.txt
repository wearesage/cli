The leaves were falling, I was seventeen
We'd been locking lips, grabbing hips, smoking cigarettes
We took a drive in your 1990 the hand-me-down
From out of town, I was California
Oh, my legs were not shaved
And you had dirt between your fingers
They told us to behave, but hey
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time
I had seen it in the magazines
We would change the channel on the TV screen
'Cause it's such a sin what ya did to me
Straight to hell is what they sell if you done the deed
Oh, but what could be so bad?
Oh, if everyone is guilty
I guess we want what we can't have
'Cause I've heard...
It's not like riding a bike
It's not like flying a kite
It's not as easy as pie
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like taking a bath
It's not like having a laugh
It's not like reading a map
It's nothing like the first time
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
It's not a walk in the park
It's not a shot in the dark
It's not a juvenile crime
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like tying the knot
There's no connecting the dots
And in case you forgot
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
La la la la la la
There's nothing like the first time
It's not like reading a map (La la la la la la)
Oh ya, you give me laugh
There's nothing like the first time
