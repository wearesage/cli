(unreleased)
Twelve noon
Watch her sleeping in your room
Why can't that still be me
Two o clock and I'm still driving round your block
Feeling a little crazy
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising that look on your face
I'm underneath your street light blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
So weeks pass and I found myself another catch
Someone who loves me equally yeah
The tables turn and you're not happy
When you learn he's moving in with me
He bought me a big ring we moved to the city
Now you won't stop calling
Cause you always thought that you'd have your plan B
Now you're showing up at my place
Not surprising we both play this game
You're underneath my street light blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
You're right outside my window throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
La la la la
La la la la
Forever
La la la la
La la la la
You'd change your number and move to the suburbs
You run but you can't hide
You thought I'd forget all of your passwords
But I like showing up at your place
So surprising that look on your face
I'm underneath your street blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love forever
I'm underneath your street blowing kisses every night
Psycho love forever
I'm right outside your window throwing rocks and starting fights
Psycho love
