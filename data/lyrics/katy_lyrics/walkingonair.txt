Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm walking on air
Tonight, ton-ton-tonight, ton-ton-tonight, I'm walking on air
You're giving me sweet, sweet ecstasy
Yeah, you take me to utopia
You're reading me like erotica
Boy, you make me feel exotic, yeah
Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and hotter than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there
I'm walking on air
Tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking, I'm walking on air
Tonight, I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air
Ton-ton-tonight, ton, to-ton
This is pure paradise
Even heaven is jealous of our love
Yes, we make angels cry
Raining down on us from up above
Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and hotter than ever before
We go higher and higher
I feel like I'm already there
I'm walking on air
Tonight, I'm walking on air
