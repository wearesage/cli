Oh my God, were you looking at her butt?
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
You're going out with your guys tonight (Right)
And you can flirt, boy, shop the windows displays
They'll get you drunk, best behave, alright? (Alright)
Yeah, I let you walk the line 'cause you come home every time
And I will never give you reasons not to
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way (Come on)
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (Don't touch)
You can look but you can't touch, uh-huh (Uh-huh)
You can look but you can't touch
You can look at her butt (Her butt)
You can look but you can't touch her butt (Uh-huh)
Don't touch, don't even think about it
I'll be your bad girl when you come later tonight
I'll be your treat to feed your appetite
You wouldn't dare leave me home alone too long
And get me thinking something's really wrong
Yeah, I'll let you tow my line, you'll be the captain every time
I'll let you think you're in control of this ship
You're such a good boy and let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way
Yeah, let's keep it that way

You can look at her butt
You can look but you can't touch her butt (What?)
I saw you looking at her butt, it's so J-E-L-L-O
You said you'd get me another drink, but I saw you say "hello"
You think I'm blind, you think I'm deaf and you think that I'm dumb
I ain't your Helen Keller, honey, I'm your number one
Don't you forget it
You can look but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (Don't you forget it)
