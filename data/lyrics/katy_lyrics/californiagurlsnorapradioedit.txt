I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet, and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (undone)
The boys break their necks tryna creep a little sneak peek (at us)
You could travel the world, but nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love, oh...
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes bikinis on top
Sun kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle, oh...
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up, oh...
Sex on the beach, we don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep, Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, uh-oh
You could travel the world, but nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us, you'll be falling in love, oh...
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes bikinis on top
Sun kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle, oh...
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up, oh...
California, California girls
California, California girls
Whoa, yeah
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes bikinis on top (hey!)
Sun kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle, oh...
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up, oh...
California, California girls
California, California girls
