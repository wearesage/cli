Dancing in the blurry lights
Found you in paradise
Floating in the diamond sky
Our bodies synchronize
Hypnotized
Am I dreamin'?
Feel the rise
I'm tinglin'
In your eyes
Adrenaline
Baby, I'm, I'm tremblin'
Show me that you're gonna
Take me to nirvana
Show me that you're gonna
Take me to nirvana
Dancing in the blurry lights
Found you in paradise
Floating in the diamond sky
Our bodies synchronize
You make me feel, make me feel so high
You make me feel, make me feel alive
Breathe me in, another dose
Take a ride on my rainbow
Keep it up, I'm getting close
About to hit kaleidoscope
Show me that you're gonna
Take me to nirvana
Show me that you're gonna
Take me to nirvana
Dancing in the blurry lights (Blurry lights)
Found you in paradise (Paradise)
Floating in the diamond sky (Diamond sky)
Our bodies synchronize (Synchronize)
You make me feel, make me feel so high
You make me feel, make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
