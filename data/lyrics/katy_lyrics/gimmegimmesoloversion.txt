Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time
Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight
Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Tell me, baby, 'cause I'm listening
Stimulate me with your fantasies
Say the right thing, maybe you can be
Crawlin' on me like a centipede
Freaks only come out at night
Tryna flex in the texts
They all bark with no bite (With no bite)
Please, gotta know what I like
Turn me on all night long
And you know that I might (That I might)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time
Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight
Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Tryna get it, gotta play the game
Keep me spinnin' like a hurricane
Drive me crazy, baby, use your brain
Juicy, juicy, like a candy cane
Freaks only come out at night
Tryna flex in the texts
They all bark with no bite (With no bite)
Please, gotta know what I like
Turn me on all night long
And you know that I might (That I might)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
Gimme, gimme, baby, stop wastin' my time (Wastin' my time)
Kitty, kitty, wanna come party tonight (Party tonight)
Trippy, trippy, daddy, take me on a ride (Me on a ride)
If you want my body, gotta blow my mind (Blow my mind)
