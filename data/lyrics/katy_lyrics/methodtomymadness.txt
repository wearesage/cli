You know there's a method
There's a method to my madness
You just need to trust it
Please just trust the process
But you're short-sighted
So narrow minded
You don't know it all
I've got the greatness
Flesh full of aces
And I know something you don't
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
You break me off but I've become higher than helium
An antidote, you slippin' on (so sip on)
'Cause there's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my
To my madness
I know where I'm headed
Just watch me manifest it
You see it all in hindsight
Hope you don't miss the message
Don't be short-sighted
So narrow minded
You don't know it all
No you can't fake this
It's not contagious
And I know something you don't
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
You break me off but I've become higher than helium
An antidote, you slippin' on (so sip on)
'Cause there's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my
To my madness
(There's a method to my madness)
(There's a method to my madness)
Boy, you think this is easy
Then you should try your way (Ah)
I make this look easy
Rome wasn't built in a day
Hear me when I say
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
You break me off but I've become higher than helium
An antidote, you slippin' on (so sip on)
'Cause there's a method to my madness
To my, to my, to my madness
There's a method to my madness
There's a method to my madness
