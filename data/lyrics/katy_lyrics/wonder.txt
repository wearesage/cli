One day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
One day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
Someday when we're wiser
Will our hearts still have that fire?
Can somebody promise me
Our innocence doesn't get lost in a cynical world?
One day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
Stay wild, beautiful child
Don't let the weight of the world
Be heavy on your wings
Stay pure, beautiful girl
Don't let the fear in the world
Burn out what you believe
'Cause one day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
Someday when we're wiser
Will our hearts still have that fire?
Can somebody promise me
Our innocence doesn't get lost in a cynical world?
One day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
Will we still look up in wonder?
Stay free, little daisy
Don't let the envious ones
Say that you're just a weed
Stay joy, beautiful boy
Don't let the ways of the world
Kill your empathy
'Cause one day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
Someday when we're wiser
Will our hearts still have that fire?
Can somebody promise me
Our innocence doesn't get lost in a cynical world?
One day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
'Cause time is gonna fly
Beauty's gonna fade
Life will let you down
'Cause time is gonna fly
Beauty's gonna fade
Don't let growing up bring you down (No)
One day when we're older
Will we still look up in wonder?
Someday when we're wiser
Will our hearts still have that fire?
