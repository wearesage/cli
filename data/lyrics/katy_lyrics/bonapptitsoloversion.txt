All that you can have, boy
Got me spread like a buffet
Bon app—bon appétit, baby
Appetite for seduction
Fresh out the oven
Melt in your mouth kind of lovin'
Bon app—bon appétit, baby

You've got those hungry eyes
You could use some sugar
'Cause your levels ain't right
I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in
You want what I'm cooking, boy

Under candle light
We can wine and dine
A table for two
And it's okay

Eat with your hands, fine
