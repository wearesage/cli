I used to know you when we were young
You were in all my dreams
We sat together in period one
Fridays at 8:15
Now I see your face in the strangest places
Movies and magazines
Yeah, I saw you talking to Christopher Walken
On my TV screen
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
I used to work at the record store
Now I work for my dad
Scraping the paint off the hardwood floors
The hours are pretty bad
Sometimes I wonder where you are
Probably in L.A.
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days
And I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah
(Ooh, ah, hey)
I will wait for you
As long as I need to
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you
And if you ever get back to Hackensack
I'll be here for you, yeah
Thank you, thank you
