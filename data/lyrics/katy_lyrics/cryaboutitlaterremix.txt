[Katy Perry:]
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

[Luísa Sonza (Katy Perry):]
And it's half past three
And I got angel wings (I'll cry about it later)
But a devil's grin (I'll cry about it later)
And only one can win (Tonight I'm gettin' some)
(Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new)

[Katy Perry (Luísa Sonza) {Both}:]
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new (Brand new)
{Oh, I'll cry about it later}
{Ooh, ooh}

[Katy Perry:]
I know tomorrow I'll be love hungover
But I'm ready for a shameless summer
Champagne on ice only makes you stronger

[Luísa Sonza:]
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

[Katy Perry (Luísa Sonza):]
And it's half past three (Past three)
And I got angel wings (And I got angel wings)
But a devil's grin (Devil's grin)
And only one can win

[Katy Perry (Luísa Sonza) {Both}:]
(I'll cry about it later)
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun

I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' (something brand new)
{Oh, I'll cry about it later}
{Ooh, ooh}

[Katy Perry:]
Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it nonstop
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her
I'll cry about it later
