Hey, it's gonna be okay
I'm always gonna be around no matter if you're up or down
Hey, what did I say?
I'm never gonna let you drown, no matter if you're up or down
Are we gonna make it?
Are we gonna fake it?
Don't always wanna face it
So we just get wasted
Let's make a toast to
Everything we've been through
'Cause I don't always like you
But I'm always gonna love you
Blood, sweat, tears, have we had enough?
Take my hand, we're not giving up
And everybody say hey, it's gonna be okay
I'm always gonna be around no matter if you're up or down (No matter if you're up or down, yeah)
Hey, what did I say? (I'm never gonna let you drown)
I'm never gonna let you drown, no matter if you're up or down (Up or down)
I'm never gonna let you drown, no matter if you're up or down
