Did somebody say Just Eat?
Ding-dong, ring-a-ding-ding-ding-dong
Did somebody say Just Eat?
Want my curry in a hurry (Medium spice)
Extra sauce on the low (Boo won't know)
And I want açai
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when I'm ordering delivery
A little sushi while I watch a movie
Papaya salad while I sing a ballad
Need some ice cream, make it a swirl
Gotta treat this California girl
When you're running low there's only one place to go
Cuz I get what I want, when I want it
Margherita with extra cheese on it
Download, now all I gotta do is pull out my phone
Easy 1, 2, 3...
Mocha-whip triple-shot, it means a latte to me
Back from the club (Sandwich)
Eating subs in the tub (Famished)
Spicy chicken when I'm ready
Bon Appétit from me, Katy Perry
