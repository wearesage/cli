Comparisons are easily done
Once you've had a taste of perfection
Like an apple hanging from a tree
I picked the ripest one, I still got the seed
You said move on, where do I go?
I guess second best is all I will know
'Cause when I'm with him, I am
Thinking of you (Thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you
What you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your eyes
Eyes
You're like an Indian summer in the middle of winter
Like a hard candy with a surprise center
How do I get better once I've had the best?
You said there's tons of fish in the water, so the waters I will test
He kissed my lips, I taste your mouth, oh (I taste your mouth)
He pulled me in, I was disgusted with myself
'Cause when I'm with him, I am
Thinking of you (Oh; thinking of you, thinking of you)
Thinking of you
Oh, what you would do if
You were the one who was
Spending the night (Spending the night, spending the night)
Oh, I wish that I
Was looking into your
Your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Looking into your eyes
Oh, won't you walk through
And bust in the door and
Take me away?
Oh, no more mistakes
'Cause in your eyes, I'd like to stay
Stay
