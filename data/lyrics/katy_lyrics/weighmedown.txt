We're looking in the same direction
But you don't see what I see
Just a half moon in your perception
It looks full to me
Oh, my head is caught, caught in clouds
But you're buried so, so far down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
Your words can pollute the future
So you should choose carefully
Cynical is a natural born killer
If it were up to me
I would say
Let's get you all medicated
So we can get dedicated
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
This is not a race
This is the relationship
But you take the cake
At being the worst in it
Try and keep me grounded
You took my faith
And nearly drowned it
This is not a test
This is the relationship
You are the best in being Mr. Negative
(You weigh me down)
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
You drag me down to earth
You stomp my heart it hurts
You weigh me down
The way you're pulling me
You're worse than gravity
You weigh me down
You weigh me down
(You weigh me down)
(Me down)
